                <h2>Why New York?</h2>
                <h3>New York, the city that never sleeps</h3>
                <p>
                New York City has long been a symbol of dreams, ambition, and endless 
                opportunity. Founded in 1624 by Dutch settlers as a small trading 
                post called New Amsterdam, the city quickly became a thriving port 
                and a gateway to the New World. In 1664, the British took control 
                and renamed it New York. Its famous nickname, “The City That Never Sleeps,” 
                captures the restless energy that runs through its streets day and night.
                </p>
                <p>
                The city’s history is etched into its skyline and neighborhoods. 
                Beyond the glass and steel of its towering skyscrapers, New York holds 
                a rich mix of cultures brought by waves of immigrants from all corners of the world. 
                From the Italian bakeries in Little Italy to the bustling markets of Chinatown, 
                every neighborhood tells a unique story. You can stroll through the historic 
                cobblestone streets of the West Village, explore the art galleries of Chelsea, 
                or take in the stately beauty of the Brooklyn Bridge.
